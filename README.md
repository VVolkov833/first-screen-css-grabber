# First Screen CSS Grabber

It grabbs all the styling (linked and inline CSS) of dom elements, positioned on the first screen of your browser.

## Usage

* Open a page, from which you would want to grab the first screen CSS, in a desktop browser
* Zoom out once or twice
* Open the browser console at the right or left and make it thin
* A perfect page view gotta be about 1440+ px width and some proportional height
* Paste the code from main.js to the console and press Enter
* If nothing changed on the first screen - awesome
* Scroll the page lower, and you will see the textarea with your first screen CSS
* It actually takes 1.1 of the screen height, just in case

You can check out the Elements tab in the console - for current test all the linked and inlined css, as well as the elements below the first screen, were removed, and the leftowers are styled by newly grabbed styles.
